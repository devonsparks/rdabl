The site of the Empire State Building, located on the west side of
Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was originally part
of an early 18th century farm. In the late 1820s, it came into the
possession of the prominent Astor family, with John Jacob Astor's
descendants building the Waldorfâ€“Astoria Hotel on the site in the
1890s. By the 1920s, the family had sold the outdated hotel and the
site indirectly ended up under the ownership of Empire State Inc., a
business venture that included businessman John J. Raskob and former
New York governor Al Smith. The original design of the Empire State
Building was for a 50-story office building. However, after fifteen
revisions, the final design was for a 86-story 1,250-foot building,
with an airship mast on top. This ensured it would be the world's
tallest building, beating the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street,
two other Manhattan skyscrapers under construction at the time that
were also vying for that distinction.
